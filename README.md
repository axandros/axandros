### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Tristan Brumagin, though I tend to go by Axandros online.
I've been coding consistently for 5 years and designing games for far longer.
My ambitions exceed my skills, but I'm slowly closing that gap.
I'm seeking new professional opportunities, so if you're interested shoot me a message.
